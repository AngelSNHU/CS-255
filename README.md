Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
Answer: The client in DriverPass was DriverPass themselves and they were looking for us, with our set of skills, to help design a system that allowed users to take practice tests/quizzes online as well as schedule driving lessons on the system as well. The system needed to be intuitive and effective for helping customers in getting their license.

What did you do particularly well?
Answer: I found I did the UML diagrams well for DriverPass, which was fundamental for visual representation of the functional behaviors of DriverPass as well as the structure.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Answer: As for some of my prior work I would look to improve would be my Client Presentation slides. With more time I would look to provide further clarity and make particular areas more detailed for an overall better presentation.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Answer: I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing and breaking down every specific needs of the user to ensure all of their specific requirements were met. Considering the user’s needs when designing the system is vital in creating an experience that is intuitive and enjoyable for the users.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Answer: When approaching design software I’ve learned that attaining all the necessary requirements is fundamental in assuring you will have a successful project. With no requirements or set goals this could lead to an unclear vision and misunderstanding of what is the mission at hand.
